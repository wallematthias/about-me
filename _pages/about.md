About me
======
I hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich, where I specialized in computational biomechanics. In 2023, I completed my Ph.D. at ETH ZÃ¼rich, focusing my research on developing CT-based imaging and computational methods to investigate bone health. My goal is to understand how mechanical stimuli contribute to bone health and to identify potential biomarkers that can monitor adverse changes in bone structure and strength caused by conditions like diabetes.



My Current Role
======
At the Bone Imaging Lab, my work explores how disease affects bone remodeling, as well as the effects of microgravity from space flight. I aim to leverage CT imaging and computer simulations to gain insight into the interplay between bone morphology, mechanical loading, and metabolic influences. My hope is that my research will uncover new ways to assess fracture risk and enable personalized approaches to improving skeletal health. I am excited to tackle these challenges at the intersection of biomechanics, computer modeling, and medical imaging.
